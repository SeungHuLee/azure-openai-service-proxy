## Introduction to the Azure AI Proxy

The goal of the Azure OpenAI proxy service is to simplify access to an Azure OpenAI `Playground-like` experience and supports Azure OpenAI SDKs, LangChain, and REST endpoints for developer events, workshops, and hackathons. Access is granted using a timebound `API Key`.

There are three primary use cases for the Azure OpenAI proxy service:

1. Access to an Azure OpenAI Web `Playground-like` experience for developers to explore the Azure OpenAI chat completion using a timebound event code.
2. Access to developer APIs is via REST endpoints and the OpenAI SDKs and LangChain. Access to these services is granted using a timebound event code. Initially, the proxy service supports the `chat completion`, `completion` and `embeddings` APIs.
3. Access to Azure AI Search.
