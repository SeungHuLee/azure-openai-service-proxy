## Introduction to the Azure AI Proxy

The goal of the Azure OpenAI proxy service is to simplify access to an AI `Playground` experience, support for Azure OpenAI SDKs, LangChain, and REST endpoints for developer events, workshops, and hackathons. Access is granted using a time bound `API Key`.

There are three primary use cases for the Azure OpenAI proxy service:

1. Access to an AI `Playground` experience for developers to explore the Azure OpenAI chat completion using a time bound event code and different models and parameters.
2. Access to developer APIs via REST endpoints and the OpenAI SDKs and LangChain. Access to these services is granted using a time bound event code. Initially, the proxy service supports the `chat completion`, `completion`, `embeddings`, `dall-e-2`, and `dall-e-3` APIs.
3. Access to Azure AI Search queries using the Azure OpenAI proxy service. Access to these services is granted using a time bound event code.

## OpenAI Proxy Playground

The Azure OpenAI proxy service provides a `Playground-like` experience for developers to explore the Azure OpenAI chat completion using the time bound event code with different models and parameters.
