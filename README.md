# Azure OpenAI Proxy

The goal of the Azure OpenAI proxy service is to simplify access to an Azure OpenAI `Playground-like` experience and supports Azure OpenAI SDKs, LangChain, and REST endpoints for developer events, workshops, and hackathons. Access is granted using a timebound `event code`.

The solution documentation is published [here](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-openai-service-proxy/).
